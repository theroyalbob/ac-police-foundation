The current website is built using wix. It has outdated information, and is not performant.

The new website will be built using a modern stack that is performant and easier to maintain.

I want to creare a more dynamic website that is easier to maintain. 

I also want to integrate some functionality into the website to make it more useful.
- The website should have integrated payments for donors (using Stripe and/or Paypal).
- The website should have a better designed events calendar.
- The website should have a better designed photo gallery.
- The website should allow for online grant applications.
- All forms on the website should integrat eand point to a single source of truth for the data.
- When someone interacts with the website appropriate notifcaiton shoudl be sent to a single foundation email.
