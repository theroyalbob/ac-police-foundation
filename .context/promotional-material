I want to send a redesigned page to the foundation to review at their next board meeting.

The page should be viewable on both mobile and desktop.

The page should have a clean, modern design.

The page should have a section for the foundation's mission and goals.

The page should have a navigation bar with links to the following pages:
- Home
- News
- Information
- Events
- Photos
- Donate

But all of the pages should say under construction.

The page should have a footer with the following sections:
- Home
- News
- Information
- Events
- Contact Us

The page will be hosted on a vercel app.
