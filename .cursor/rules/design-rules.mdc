“Follow the existing ACP Foundation branding where possible. If no official brand guidelines are available, propose a professional, modern look with a police/community theme: bold blues, gold highlights, and readable sans-serif fonts.”
“All design suggestions must be responsive and user-friendly.”


[acpf-logo.avif](mdc:.elements/logo/acpf-logo.avif) is the only design element we currently have. The logo itself should be included on the top left of all pages.
