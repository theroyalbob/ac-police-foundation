All code and design suggestions you provide must be aligned with the Atlantic City Police Foundationâ€™s mission:  to improve public safety in Atlantic City by assisting the City of Atlantic City and The Atlantic City Police Department in funding for worthwhile police programs, initiatives, training and equipment that would otherwise not be feasible under the City budget.

Design elements should emphasize trust, transparency, and community engagement.
